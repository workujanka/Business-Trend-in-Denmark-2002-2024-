# Danish Sales & Purchases Analysis

This project explores annual sales, purchases, and enterprise growth data from Statistics Denmark.  
The dataset covers 1969–2024, with totals and domestic splits for both sales and purchases.  
Data was cleaned from semicolon‑delimited CSV into a normalized format for MySQL import.  
Visualizations include enterprise growth, domestic sales share, and purchase‑to‑sales ratios.  
Charts are centered and scaled in Markdown using HTML for clear presentation.  
The goal is to provide beginner‑friendly, reproducible workflows for business data analysis.  
Queries in MySQL highlight long‑term trends and short‑term fluctuations in Danish enterprises.  
Results are visualized in Excel/Power BI and documented here for transparency.  
All charts and code are open for learning, teaching, and ethical reuse.
