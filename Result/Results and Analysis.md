Results and Analysis / Discussion
This section summarizes key trends in Denmark’s business landscape from 2002 to 2024, based on official data from Danmarks Statistik. The visualizations highlight domestic sales share, enterprise growth, purchase/sales dynamics, and cost efficiency.

🇩🇰 Share of Domestic Sales (%)
Trend: From 2002 to 2010, the domestic share of total sales remained stable above 70%. After 2010, a gradual decline began, reaching below 60% by 2020. A sharp drop occurred around 2021, falling close to 40%, followed by a partial recovery in 2022–2024.

Interpretation: This decline suggests a growing reliance on international markets or a shift in domestic consumption. The sharp dip during 2021 likely reflects pandemic-related disruptions, while the recovery hints at market stabilization.

🏢 Total Number of Enterprises
Trend: Enterprise count increased steadily from ~384,000 in 2003 to a peak of ~497,000 in 2021, followed by a slight decline through 2023.

Interpretation: This growth reflects entrepreneurial expansion and economic resilience. The recent dip may indicate market saturation, consolidation, or post-pandemic adjustments in the business environment.

📈 Growth of Purchases and Sales (%)
Trend:

2009 and 2023: Significant declines in both purchases and sales growth.

2022: Sharp rebound, with growth nearing 50%.

Most years show moderate fluctuations, with purchases and sales generally moving in tandem.

Interpretation: These patterns highlight economic cycles, with downturns linked to global crises and rebounds driven by recovery demand. The 2022 spike may reflect stimulus effects or export-driven growth, while the 2023 drop signals renewed challenges.

⚖️ Purchase to Sales Ratio (%)
Trend: The ratio fluctuated between 64–68%, dipping in 2009, then rising steadily to a peak above 69% in 2022, followed by a slight decline in 2024.

Interpretation: A rising ratio indicates higher input costs relative to sales, suggesting inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints, or margin compression. The 2022 peak implies businesses faced tighter profitability conditions.
